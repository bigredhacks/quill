        BigRed//Hacks is Cornell University’s collegiate hackathon.  Across three days, students will 
        gather from across the country to build innovative projects, meet amazing people, and win 
        cool prizes  from our fanstastic sponsors along the way!

        This year’s event will be held Oct 19 - 21, 2018 at Cornell University’s Physical Sciences 
        Building.  We aim to reimburse travel expenses as much as possible, and we’ll be sending
        buses to locations that have a lot of attendees registered.

                We are inviting all undergraduate and graduate students to participate in our hackathon. 
                You don't need any past experience. You don't even need to be a computer science major! 
                Our only requirement is that you are at least 18 years old and enrolled in an accredited 
                college or university.

                Bring your school ID for registration. You are also responsible for bringing any equipment 
                for building and demoing your hack: laptop, chargers, phones, etc. You may also want 
                to bring a sleeping bag, change of clothes, and toothbrush.

                You don't have to sign up with a team, but it's certainly more fun! We allow teams of 
                up to four people (they don't have to be from the same school), and while they can be 
                specified on the application, you won't officially create your team until the event. 
                If you don't have a team yet, we'll host a social before the hacking begins for you 
                to meet other amazing people.

                Allowances are based on the general cost of inexpensive transportation in your area. 
                You may select any method of transportation, but we will only reimburse you if you qualify
                for it. If you believe that this amount is unfair, then please reach out to us and we'll 
                make adjustments as necessary. Notes for drivers: We ask that you make every effort to 
                carpool with as many students as possible in your school. We will provide a Facebook 
                page for you to find others in your area. Parking is free at Cornell after 5pm on Friday 
                through Sunday. We are not responsible for any fines for parking violations.

                We will be providing a dedicated hardware lab with sensors, microcontrollers, and basic

                that you bring your own equipment if you know that you'll absolutely need it.

                We want BigRed//Hacks to be fun and fair for everyone. Your project should be started 
                from scratch and worked on only during the 36 hours, and you may only incorporate outside 
                resources (code, graphics, sound, etc) that are freely licensed and accessible to all 
                participants equally. Of course, maintain a positive, respectful attitude toward your 
                fellow hackers throughout the event.
